## Background

### About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a 
fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad 
consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its 
pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase 
single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual 
memberships are Cyclistic members. 

### Scenario

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of 
annual memberships. 
Accordingly, the marketing analyst team needs:

1. **To better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.**
2. **Why casual riders would buy a membership.** 
3. **How digital media could affect their marketing tactics.** 

The team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends. From 
these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual 
members.

#### Guiding questions

* **What is the problem you are trying to solve?**

In order for the marketing department would design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual
riders into annual members, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members 
and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect 
their marketing tactics.

* **How can your insights drive business decisions?**

The insights will help the marketing team to create a proper marketing campaign and to increase the 
number of annual members.


#### Key tasks

* **Identify the business task**

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?


* **Consider key stakeholders**

Director of Marketing, marketing analytics team, and Cyclistic`s Executive Team.


#### Deliverable

* **A clear statement of the business task**

I need to show how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.



## Prepare

To start working on the data we need to install the packages and load them.


#### Guiding questions

* **Where is your data located?** 

The data is located in a Kaggle dataset.


* **How is the data organized?** 

Each data set contains the details of rides logged by the customers.


* **Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?** 

Bias isn`t an issue,  because the data is provided by company clients as bike
riders. The population of the data set is the bike riders and has a full
quality for it. The data is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and
cited as well.
  
* **How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?** 

The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. 
under this [license](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
Personal information of customers has been removed to respect data-privacy issues.

* **How did you verify the data’s integrity?** 

The population of the data set is the bike riders and has a full
quality for it.All the files have consistent columns and each column has the correct type of data.

* **How does it help you answer your question?**

It may have some key insights about the riders and their riding style.

* **Are there any problems with the data?**

It will be good to receive the last updated data.


#### Key tasks 

* Download data and store it appropriately. 
* Identify how it’s organized. 
* Sort and filter the data.
* Determine the credibility of the data.


#### Deliverable 

* **A description of all data sources used.**

In this data set, are existing the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data from April 2021 until 
April 2022 by Motivate International Inc [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).



## Process

In this step, we will merge all the CSV files into one file to improve our process, identify data 
types and errors, and rename columns if needed.


#### Key tasks

* Check the data for errors. 
* Transform the data to work with it effectively.
* Document the cleaning process.


#### Deliverable

* **Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data**

  Install packages for working:

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse") 
#install.packages("ggplot2")  
#install.packages("lubridate")
#install.packages("janitor")
#install.packages("skimr")
#install.packages("palmerpenguins") 
  
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse) # Collection of R packages designed for data science.
library(ggplot2)   # For visualization.
library(lubridate) # Makes it easier to work with date-times.
library(dplyr)     # Provides a set of tools for efficiently manipulating.
library(janitor)   # Cleaning dirty data.
library(skimr)     # To work with (grouped) data frames.
```

#### Collect the Data

The data has existing in Kaggle and is organized by columns for each data set. 
[here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)


* Download the previous 12 months in new folder.
* Unzip each data set and using just the .CSV files (12 CSV files).
* To load the data inside RStudio, use read_csv function.

```{r}
Apr21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202104-divvy-tripdata.csv")
May21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202105-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Jun21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202106-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Jul21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Aug21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202108-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Sep21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Okt21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Nov21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Dec21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Jan22 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Feb22 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Mar22 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```


#### Checking the Data

Here we can check the information about the data sets like data types, name columns, etc.
In this phase, it is important to see that all of our columns in all datasets are the same 
as the rest in order to merge them properly.

```{r}
# For example
colnames(Apr21)
str(Apr21)
summary(Apr21)

glimpse(Apr21) # Return arranged data horizontally.
glimpse(May21)
glimpse(Jun21)
glimpse(Jul21)
glimpse(Aug21)
glimpse(Sep21)
glimpse(Okt21)
glimpse(Nov21)
glimpse(Dec21)
glimpse(Jan22)
glimpse(Feb22)
glimpse(Mar22)                                                    
```

* I recognized that ",Apr21" dataset, in columns "started_at" and, "ended_at" are "character" data
  type. So we need to change them to "datetime" like all the rest of the datasets.

**Let`s import it again, but with the right types.**

```{r}
Apr21 <- read_csv("../input/cyclistic-datasets-april-2021-march-2022/202104-divvy-tripdata.csv", 
    col_types = cols(started_at = col_datetime(format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M"), 
        ended_at = col_datetime(format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")))

glimpse(Apr21) # For checking the data types after the change.                                                   
```


#### Cleaning the Data

After we have checked that all the data sets have some data types in the columns, let`s remove the 
columns that are not useful in each data set.

```{r} 
# Delete columns that are not relevant.
Apr21 <- Apr21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
May21 <- May21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Jun21 <- Jun21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Jul21 <- Jul21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Aug21 <- Aug21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Sep21 <- Sep21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Okt21 <- Okt21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Nov21 <- Nov21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Dec21 <- Dec21 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Jan22 <- Jan22 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Feb22 <- Feb22 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
Mar22 <- Mar22 %>% 
  select(-c(start_lat:end_lng))
```

#### Combining all the datasets into one

To combine all the rows from all datasets, lets use the function "bind_rows"().

```{r}                                                    
trips_data_merged <- bind_rows(Apr21, May21, Jun21, Jul21, Aug21, Sep21, Okt21, Nov21, Dec21, Jan22, Feb22, Mar22)

#View(trips_data_merged) # For checking.                                                    
```

#### Remove duplicates

After we merged all the data sets to one, we can check for duplicates and remove them from our data. 
I used the function "!duplicated" that determines which elements of a vector or data frame are duplicates. 
We can use "duplicated" to identify the duplicated "ride id" as well.

```{r}
trip_data_merged_nodup <- trips_data_merged[!duplicated(trips_data_merged$ride_id),]

#duplicated(trips_data_merged$ride_id)  Option to check it 

#summary(trip_data_merged_nodup)                                                      
```


#### Rename columns

Let`s rename the column names.

```{r}                                                      
trips_data_v1 <- trip_data_merged_nodup %>% 
  rename(customer_type = member_casual, start_time = started_at, 
         end_time = ended_at)

#View(trips_data_v1)
summary(trips_data_v1)                                                      
```


#### Manipulating the data

Before we move to the analysis phase, we need to create new columns that will help us understand how 
annual members and casual riders differ.

Columns to create:

* Ride length in minutes.
* Day of the week to identify patterns

```{r}                                                     
# ride_time_m

trips_data_v2 <- trips_data_v1 %>% 
  mutate(ride_time_m = as.numeric(trips_data_v1$end_time - trips_data_v1$start_time) / 60)

#summary(trips_data_v2)                    
```

For calculating ride time we need to change the type to number 
                                                      
```{r}                                                      
trips_data_v2$ride_time_m <- as.numeric(as.character(trips_data_v2$ride_time_m))
is.numeric(trips_data_v2$ride_time_m)      # for checking
```


```{r}                                                     
#day_of_week
# We need to classify the columns "started_at" and "ended_at"
class(trips_data_v2$start_time)
class(trips_data_v2$end_time)

# Both of them are "POSIXct" "POSIXt" 

# Now we need to create columns for each ride such "day", "month", "year" that will help us to identify more insight.

trips_data_v2$date <- as.Date(trips_data_v2$start_time) # We already know that is "POSIXct" "POSIXt"
trips_data_v2$month <- format(as.Date(trips_data_v2$date), "%m_%y") # Extracts "month_year" from yyyy-mm-dd.
trips_data_v2$day <- format(as.Date(trips_data_v2$date), "%d")
trips_data_v2$year <- format(as.Date(trips_data_v2$date), "%Y")
trips_data_v2$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(trips_data_v2$date),"%a") # "%a" = weekday.

glimpse(trips_data_v2)                                                     
```

We can check for negative rows in our "ride_time_m" by "nrow" function.
nrow() = used to return the number of rows of the specified matrix.

subset() = Is a useful indexing feature for accessing object elements. It can be used to select and 
filter variables and observations. 

```{r}
nrow(subset(trips_data_v2, ride_time_m <0))
```
* Like we can see, we have 141 rows with negative results. We will use this command to create a new 
  filtered variable without the negative results.

```{r}
trips_data_v3 <- trips_data_v2[!(trips_data_v2$ride_time_m<0),]
#summary(trips_data_v3)
```


#### Guiding questions

* **What tools are you choosing and why?**

  I`m using RStudio Desktop for this project, for two main reasons: Because of the large dataset and 
  to gather experience with the language.

* **Have you ensured your data’s integrity?**

  Yes, all the files have consistent columns and each column has the correct type of data.

* **What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?**

  First, the columns were formatted to their correct format, the columns were renamed, duplicated 
  values were removed, and then I added new columns for forwarding analysis.

* **How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?**

  I documented in this notebook all the processes.

* **Have you documented your cleaning process, so you can review and share those results?**

  Yes, it`s all documented in this R notebook.



## Analyze 

This data phase will help us find insights as well as understand how annual members and casual riders 
use Cyclistic bikes differently.

#### Key tasks

* Aggregate your data, so it’s useful and accessible.
* Organize and format your data.
* Perform calculations.
* Identify trends and relationships.

#### Deliverable

* A summary of your analysis

let`s create variable for our analyze phase.
```{r}
trips_data_analyze <- trips_data_v3
```

Let`s have a quick view 
                                                      
```{r}
summary(trips_data_analyze)
```
After quick overview, we can see In the ride_time section:

* The maximum ride time results are 55,944.15 minutes, that mean, 
  55944.15 / 60 / 24 = 38.85 days.

* Average time ride is 21.54 minutes.

### Testing analysis

```{r}
# Compare members and casual users

aggregate(trips_data_analyze$ride_time_m ~ trips_data_analyze$customer_type, FUN = mean)
aggregate(trips_data_analyze$ride_time_m ~ trips_data_analyze$customer_type, FUN = median)
aggregate(trips_data_analyze$ride_time_m ~ trips_data_analyze$customer_type, FUN = max)
aggregate(trips_data_analyze$ride_time_m ~ trips_data_analyze$customer_type, FUN = min)
```
* We can see that our values compare the two customer types by average, median,max, and min. It 
  differs the results from the “summary” function by having the customer type.


### Casuals vs members

This step is to measure how much data are for each group.
                                                      
```{r}
trips_data_analyze %>% 
  group_by(customer_type) %>% 
  summarise(count = length(ride_id), precent =  length(ride_id)/nrow(trips_data_analyze)*100) 
```
The LENGTH( ) function counts the number of characters in the string, including any spaces, and 
returns the number.

```{r}
ggplot_v1 <- ggplot(trips_data_analyze) +
         geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=customer_type, fill=customer_type)) +
         labs(title = "Chart 1: Casuals Vs Members", subtitle = "Number Of Users")

# as we can, we have number in unreadable format on the y axis. to change that we need to you the "scales" function

library(scales)

ggplot_v1 +                          # Modify formatting of axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```

**Insights:**

* As we can see, the clients of the company are 55.5% members, and 45% casuals.


```{r}
# See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
aggregate(trips_data_analyze$ride_time_m ~ trips_data_analyze$customer_type + trips_data_analyze$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

```
**Insights:**

* We can see the average time ridden per day differ by customer type, and see it   clear that the 
  casual riders use the service more than members every day.



Let`s find the number of rides, and the average time per day that differs by customer type.

```{r}
# analyze ridership data by type and weekday
trips_data_analyze %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(customer_type, weekday) %>%                  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(), #calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  average_duration = mean(ride_time_m)) %>%  # calculates the average duration
  arrange(customer_type, weekday) # sorts
```

Let`s visualize the number of rides by rider type.

```{r}
ggplot_adj <- trips_data_analyze %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE)) %>%  
  group_by(customer_type, weekday) %>%                 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_time_m)) %>% 
  arrange(customer_type, weekday) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = customer_type)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    labs(title = "Chart 2: Casuals Vs Members", subtitle = "Ridership Data By Type and Weekday")

ggplot_adj +                          # Modify formatting of axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```
**Insights:**

* Quick overview can show us that member riders use weekdays more than casual riders. However, 
  casual riders used it at weekends more than member riders.


Let`s compare each client type by ride time per month. 

```{r}
trips_data_analyze %>% 
    group_by(month) %>%                                       
    summarise(count = length(ride_id),                  # The number of rides each month
            percent = (length(ride_id)/nrow(trips_data_analyze))*100,
            'members_p' = (sum(customer_type == "member") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            'casual_p' = (sum(customer_type == "casual") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
            'Member x Casual Per Diff' = members_p - casual_p)
```

```{r}
ggplot_v2 <- ggplot(trips_data_analyze) +
                   geom_bar(mapping = aes(month, fill = customer_type)) +
                   labs(title = "Chart 3: Casuals Vs Members", 
                        subtitle = "Using Per Month") +
                   coord_flip()                            # Flip the bar chart.

ggplot_v2 +                          # Modify formatting of axis
          scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```
**Insights:**

* The member riders use more than the casual riders in the months of October until April. However, 
  from Mai until September, the casual riders use as equal or even more than the member riders.
* The member riders are active consistently throughout the year.
* Months from December to March, the bikes rental use is low for both customer types, mostly because 
  of winter.


Let`s compare our results with climate data for Chicago. The data will be taken by Google.
 
```{r}
chicago_avg_temp <- c(-4, -4, 4, 8, 10, 15, 22, 25, 24, 14, 6, -1)
month <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")

data.frame(month, chicago_avg_temp) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=month, y=chicago_avg_temp, fill = "")) +
    labs(x="Month", y="avg temperature", title="Chart 4: Mean Temperature for Chicago", subtitle =      "April. 2020 - March. 2021") +
    geom_col()
```

**Insights:**

* Temperature heavily influences the volume of rides every month.


#### Start Hour

The hour of the day also may be useful for analysis.

```{r}
trips_data_analyze <- trips_data_analyze %>%
    mutate(start_hour = strftime(trips_data_analyze$end_time, "%H"))
unique(trips_data_analyze$start_hour)

glimpse(trips_data_analyze)
```

#### The hourly use

```{r}
trips_data_analyze %>%
    group_by(start_hour) %>% 
    summarise(count = length(ride_id),
          'percent' = (length(ride_id) / nrow(trips_data_analyze)) * 100,
          'members_p' = (sum(customer_type == "member") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
          'casuals_p' = (sum(customer_type == "casual") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
          'member_casual_percent_differ' = members_p - casuals_p)
```

Let`s visualize it.

```{r}
ggplot_v3 <- ggplot(trips_data_analyze) + 
             geom_bar(mapping = aes(start_hour, fill=customer_type)) +
             labs(title = "Chart 5: Casuals Vs Members", subtitle = "Using Per Hour")

ggplot_v3 +                          # Modify formatting of axis
          scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```

**Insights:**

* The afternoon is the busiest time.
* The busiest time in the morning is 7- 9 am.
* The busiest time in the evening is 5-7 pm.
* We can assume that most member riders use the bikes to go to work and back.
* The casual riders` use peak is between 4-7 pm.


We can also see that per day of the week.

```{r}
ggplot(trips_data_analyze) + 
       geom_bar(mapping = aes(start_hour, fill=customer_type)) +
       labs(title = "Chart 7: Casuals Vs Members", subtitle = "Using Per Hour") +
       facet_wrap(~ day_of_week)
```

### Weekends vs Midweeks

             mutate(type_of_weekday = ifelse(day_of_week == 'Sat' | day_of_week == 'Sun',
                                   'Weekends', 'Midweeks')) %>%
                                            ggplot(aes(start_hour, fill=customer_type)) +

**Insights:**

* The weekends have a solid flow of data points.
* The midweek has a more steep flow of data.

We can assume that the members may be people who use the bikes during their daily routine activities, 
like going to work and coming back from work.

#### Which bike types prefer customers?

```{r}
trips_data_analyze %>%
          group_by(rideable_type) %>% 
          summarise(count = length(ride_id),
          'percent' = (length(ride_id) / nrow(trips_data_analyze)) * 100,
          'members_p' = (sum(customer_type == "member") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
          'casual_p' = (sum(customer_type == "casual") / length(ride_id)) * 100,
          'member_casual_percent_differ' = members_p - casual_p)
```

Let`s visualize it.

```{r}
ggplot_v6 <- ggplot(trips_data_analyze) + 
             geom_bar(mapping = aes(rideable_type, fill=customer_type)) +
             labs(x=" Bike Type", y="Total Number of Rides",title = "Chart 9: Casuals Vs Members", subtitle = "Bike Types Preferation")
             
ggplot_v6 +                          # Modify formatting of axis
          scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```
**Insights:**

* Classic bikes are used most by members and casual riders. 
* Members and casual customers both use electric bikes.
* Docked bikes are used just by casual customers as well as the lowest use among   all.


#### Guiding questions

* **How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?**

The data has been organized into a single CSV after it has been merged as well as other columns 
were added for the analysis.

* **Has your data been properly formatted?**

Yes, all the columns have their correct data type.

* **What surprises did you discover in the data?**

The most surprising insight was the use on the weekends compared to the weekdays, and especially 
how members differ from casuals used. One more insight that I saw and really liked is the large use 
of the classic bike compared to others.
In general, I think that more and more people want to be healthier in their life, and that was a 
beautiful proof of that.

* **What trends or relationships did you find in the data?**

  1. There are more members than casuals in the dataset.
  2. Members use weekdays more than casual.      
  3. Casual used at weekends more than the member.
  4. Temperature heavily influences the volume of rides every month.
  5. There are more rides on summer.
  6. Members and casuals use differently the service
  7. Members have less riding time.
  8. Members and casual tend to prefer classic bikes.

* **How will these insights help answer your business questions?**

With these insights, I can show trends and relationships of customers and how they differ from each 
other and build a profile that helps to attract new members. 



## Share

In this phase, we want to be sophisticated and polished in order to effectively communicate with the 
executive team.

#### Key tasks 

* Determine the best way to share your findings. 
* Create effective data visualizations (Analyze phase).
* Present your findings. 
* Ensure your work is accessible.


#### Deliverable 

* Supporting visualizations and key findings.


#### Guiding questions 

* **Were you able to answer the question of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes 
  differently?**

Yes, by the analysis phase, I differentiated the member riders from the casual riders and identified 
trends and relationships between the data. 

* **What story does your data tell?**

The story from our data has shown us, at first, that the company has more members than casuals clients
and every type of customer has a different schedule of use. 
At weekends the casual riders used the service more than member riders, however, interest insight is 
when the average time ridden per day differs by customer type, it is clear that the casual riders use
the service more than members every day. 
On weekdays the member riders use it more than the casual riders, and we can guess, they are going to 
work because of the hours of use.
Summers are busier than winter, and the temperature heavily influences the volume of rides every month. 
The most surprising insight was that members riders have less riding time even though there are a 
bigger amount of customers in our data. 
One more important insight is the   change in people for a healthy lifestyle, and the data shows that
members and casual tend to prefer classic bikes more than all.


* **How do your findings relate to your original question?**

The findings show a profile for members,  and all are based on the data from the company. The target 
that always was in front of me was to find the keys of differences between casuals and annual riders.


* **Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them?**

Director of Marketing, Marketing Analytics Team, and Cyclistic`s Executive Team. The best way to      
communicate with them is through a slide presentation.


* **Can data visualization help you share your findings?** 

Yes, when we present our analysis and insights, we want to be clear and simple as possible. Our 
visualizations, with the right key points, can simplify the data even if our audience does not 
understand tables and complex data.


* **Is your presentation accessible to your audience?**

Yes, the PowerPoint presentation is available to the audience.



## Act

In this phase, we want to recommend to the marketing team our top three recommendations based on our 
analysis.


#### Guiding questions

* **What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?**
  
Members and casuals have different routines when using the bikes, however, casuals have more riding 
time than members.


* **How could your team and business apply your insights?**

With the profile that we created for the members and casuals, the team can generate a marketing campaign
for turning casuals into members as well as foster the existing members.


* **What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your findings?** 
  
I would go forward with the existing analysis and the new data that has to come and control the 
procedure by feedback for changes or adjustments as well. The marketing team can use the insights
from this analysis to build a marketing campaign for turning casuals into members, as well as foster
the existing members.


* **Is there additional data you could use to expand on your findings?**

1. Competitors` data.
2. Anticipate the climate data for the forward campaign.
3. Forward analysis with the new data.
 
 

#### Key tasks

* Create your portfolio. 
* Add your case study. 
* Practice presenting your case study to a friend or family member.

#### Deliverable

My top three recommendations based on my analysis:

[Link to the slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qXVP5OQXSop1GERI4Qh5D5CfdcCciIct/view?usp=sharing)

* **Specific recommendations for the campaign:**

1. We already know that casual riders use the service more than members, so this is a good chance to 
   offer memberships to these customers by showing them the value for money vs time riding.

2. Use the winter for attracting new customers and increase the discounts for existing and new users 
   by weekly and monthly discounts as well as for the first year of annual membership for new users.

3. Offer a combination of deals for casuals riders and members that use the bikes during the hours 
   with low traffic to attract more traffic and fill the gaps in these hours.

    
* **General recommendations for the future:** 

1. Awareness of good health. 

2. Sustainability for affordable and clean energy in order to protect the planet.
